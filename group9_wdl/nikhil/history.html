        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Mumbai, the centre for quality medical care not only across India, but
            also the South Asia. A city that has a rich medical history. Situated in South Mumbai is the omega Hospital
            and Medical Research Centre, the medical hub of India’s biggest metropolis.

            Established over five decades ago, in 1952, The omega Hospital was the result of the enormous philanthropy
            displayed by Shri Mohanji Gupta, Founder Chairman of the omega Hospital Trust. It began as a 440 bed
            hospital whose objective was, in its founder’s words, “to render the same level of service to the poor that
            the rich would get in a good hospital.”

            Today, the hospital has grown to house over 830 beds, some of the country’s most advanced diagnostic &
            surgical equipment, and offers a comprehensive range of specialised medical services. The objective however,
            remains unchanged. Which is why 33% of the patients treated are in the general ward and pay only for their
            medicines and consumables. The free OPD at the hospital successfully treats in excess of 1,00,000 patients
            each year.

            Ever since it was established in 1952, the omega Hospital has instilled in its patients a sense of genuine
            trust. Trust that has been built by combining superior medical treatment with a caringly humane attitude.
            Which is why, in excess of two lakh people confidently walk through its hallowed doors every year, year
            after year.

            It is on this sound foundation that the hospital has based its pursuit of excellence in every field of
            medical specialisation. This has seen fruition in the form of the Medical Research Centre now known as the M
            P Medical Centre.
            <img src="i13.png" align=right top><br>

            The omega Hospital presently ranks among the finest multi-speciality tertiary level medical centres in the
            country. The internationally renowned panel of doctors and consultants in every field of specialisation
            have, at their disposal, cutting-edge equipment. Supported by a highly trained and professional nursing
            staff. Little wonder then, that the omega Hospital attracts patients from every strata of society. Be it a
            factory worker from rural India, a high-flying executive from a multi-national company or the likes of
            former Prime Minister and Governor of Maharashtra.


            omega Hospital – Khargone was started in Khargone in October 2003, a 600-bedded super-specialty tertiary
            care referral center with world-class medical facilities under one roof. The hospital has world-class
            infrastructure with state-of-the-art and sophisticated technology. And apart from world-class medical
            facilities, it is Human Touch & Care by which the hospital has been able to gain trust of people. The
            hospital offers comprehensive tertiary healthcare facilities, and is offering services for all
            superspecialties like Neurosurgery, Urology, Cardio thoracic surgery, Orthopedics including Joint
            Replacements, Onco surgery, Plastic Surgery, Neurology, Cardiology, Gastroenterology, Nephrology, and broad
            specialties like General Medicine, Pediatrics, General and Laparoscopic Surgery etc.

            The hospital offers highly qualified doctors of their specific streams whether it be cardiac or
            Neurosurgery, each one of them is an expert in his field with vast experience. Most of the consultants are
            from AIIMS, PGI, SGPGI or foreign trained, giving international performance standards. omega Hospital has a
            team of highly trained Nurses to take quality care of the patients. omega Hospital has its own Nursing
            College to produce Qualified and Trained Nursing brigade.

            omega Hospital is the only NABH accredited Hospital in Madhya Pradesh. NABH is an acronym for National
            Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH), founded by the Government of India in 2006
            as a benchmark for excellence in health care. NABH has an exhaustive list of over 500 distinct elements that
            need to be fully implemented and operational in order to get the NABH accreditation. NABH is based on the
            crux of clear & transparent policies and protocols that attempt to provide quality care for patients. omega
            Hospital Indore has been awarded “The best Hospital in Non-Metro Category-Western Region” in the India
